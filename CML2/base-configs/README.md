# Base Configs

Here are some CML2 base configs to get started.

These labs were designed to use real hardware equipment so some commands might not be available

Not all labs are created at the moment, so feel free to contribute :)

You can use a free CML2 instance on DevNet Sandbox: http://bitly.com/freecml
