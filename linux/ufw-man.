       default allow|deny|reject DIRECTION
              change the default policy for traffic going DIRECTION, where DIRECTION is one of incoming, outgoing or  routed.  Note
              that  existing  rules will have to be migrated manually when changing the default policy. See RULE SYNTAX for more on
              deny and reject.

       logging on|off|LEVEL
              toggle logging. Logged packets use the LOG_KERN syslog facility. Systems configured for rsyslog support may also  log
              to  /var/log/ufw.log.  Specifying  a  LEVEL turns logging on for the specified LEVEL. The default log level is 'low'.
              See LOGGING for details.

       reset  Disables and resets firewall to installation defaults. Can also give the --force option to perform the reset  without
