    "#### 00:00:00\n",
    "Hey, guys, and welcome back to another skill in Python for network engineers. OK, so what we're going to be covering in this skill right here is a really important topic, actually, if you are in network engineer. No doubt, if you're managing networks, administering networks, you want to be documenting many aspects about your network.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:00:31\n",
    "Now, very commonly within many networks, you're going to see this documentation is going to take in the form of spreadsheets. So, this is really what we're going to be focusing on and the skill right here, spreadsheets, otherwise known as CSVs, Comma Separated Values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:00:47\n",
    "This is how we can actually delimit our values within those spreadsheets. So, you as a network engineer, maybe you're doing this type of task manually. You've been told by your bosses or your team to maybe collate information about your network, maybe things like the version numbers of your devices, maybe how many devices you have, things like serial numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:01:08\n",
    "You might even use a spreadsheet for what's called IPAM. This is IP Address Management. Basically, it's where you can document all of your IP address and maybe all of your management IP addresses, so on and so forth. Now, if you have two or three devices within your network, then this task really is quite simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:01:27\n",
    "There's not an awful lot to do. You can do it manually without much headache. The issue does arise-- and this is so often the case when we use automation-- is that when we scale up, then things do become a little bit more cumbersome, a little bit harder to get done.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:01:41\n",
    "Sometimes, you might spend days, weeks, maybe even months, depending on how large your network is, doing all of this type of documentation. Now, the good news is, is that you and I, we are learning Python together. And Python, being a programming language, and a flexible programming language, that is going to help us do this job much, much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:02:01\n",
    "It's going to save us a lot of stress and a lot of time. So, that is a big win for you and I. So, we are going to be looking at within this skill right here, we're going to be exploiting the CSV module within Python. This is going to allow us to easily work with these comma separated values, these spreadsheet-like documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:02:21\n",
    "And we'll learn how to do things like read from our spreadsheets. We'll check at how we can parse information from our spreadsheets, as well as write to new spreadsheets entirely. And we'll also try to take what we've learned within this skill and maybe do some more real world networking methods, or rather, do some examples relating to real world networking-- i.e. we can pull information from our devices, such as serial numbers, maybe IP addresses, host names, and automatically populate this value, document these values within our spreadsheets using the CSV module.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:02:54\n",
    "This is going to be way better than manually logging into each device via SSH, or worse, Telnet, doing your show commands, taking that data, and hopefully not fat fingering it and incorrectly copying it to that spreadsheet. By doing this all via automation, we're going to do this much quicker.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:03:11\n",
    "But not just that, but also going to do it much more reliably, much more accurately. So, this is a big, big win for us in all aspects. So, this skill really should pull together many of the things that we have already learned within this course. And we'll get to see how we can put so much of this information together to utilize a real world practical solution for us as network engineers using the Python programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:03:35\n",
    "So, a lot to get to within this skill. The first thing we're going to be checking out is this CSV module, and that's what we'll be doing in the very next Nugget. So, I hope this has been informative for you, and I'd like to thank you for viewing."

    "## <span style=\"color:cyan\">The CSV Module</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:00:00\n",
    "Hey, guys and welcome back. So let's take a look at that Python CSV module then, shall we? Now like always when we're using these new tools, these new modules and libraries, my suggestion is to always look at the documentation first just to get a good feel for what you're trying to do, and what the tool is actually capable of.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:00:30\n",
    "So following that advice, let's go and check out the docs. So if you just happen to Google for Python CSV, it will take you to the Python documentation on Python.org. Let's click this link here for CSV. So we get a brief description about what this module is all about.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:00:46\n",
    "Now it tells us the CSV the comma separated values format as the most important Import/Export format for spreadsheets and databases. This is why it is so useful to understand how to utilize this module right here using Python. Now what I will say before we actually use the CSV, it's known as comma separated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:01:07\n",
    "This is how we can separate out or different values. Let's say maybe we had a column for the first name, which would be my forename, and we had another column for a second name or surname, as it's otherwise known, and the column for let's just maybe see that person's email.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:01:24\n",
    "Then the way we could separate a value is between forename, surname and email is by using a comma. That is the standard, that the limits are going to be using. So say, for example, we can say John, mcgovern from a surname and then comma and I'll just say ipvzero@gmail.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:01:44\n",
    "You get the draft. So these commas are what actually separate the different values here. But an important thing to note here is that even though this is called a CSV module, it suggests that the only way to separate a values is to use a comma. The reality is that this module is going to allow you to use different delimeters, if you so choose, you can maybe use stars, or you can maybe use tab keys so on and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:02:07\n",
    "Now the key thing here within this module here, is that we're going to have some of these methods here, such as the written methods. Now a really important topic here, and we're going to see this within the module contents as at this CSV module is going to have certain functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:02:23\n",
    "Functions which allow us to work with these spreadsheets. The first one, the perhaps most obvious one, is to how to read a spreadsheet, and we can do that using the reader function here. So keep that in your back pocket CSV has a reader function. And if we scroll on down, we're going to see a short example showing how we can use the CSV module using the reader function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:02:46\n",
    "So clearly wealth is very important to be able to read from your spreadsheets. It's also very important to be able to write to a spreadsheet, and the CSV module does provide the function for us to be able to do just that. That means that say, for example, we could use our automation tools such as the Scrapli library which we have already seen so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:03:07\n",
    "We could use Scrapli to connect to multiple devices. We could pool that information as structured data, which you've already seen so far, and we could use that data in conjunction with the CSV rate of function to rate that information and to in ease spreadsheets, and this is what this function is going to do for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:03:26\n",
    "It's going to make all of that possible. And one which we certainly will be digging into a little bit later as this decked reader class here. This is going to allow us to map our values using the field names as keys. So let's say we had a CSV file at the very top we were listing forenames.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:03:43\n",
    "So forename, and we also had a surname. We could have John here, and McGovern here, and then maybe Simona. We'll say Millham What the debt reader would do, would be to baint the field here as a dictionary key, and we would have a value corresponding to that.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:04:02\n",
    "So we'd have a value John corresponds to the forename and the value Simona corresponding to the forename field, which would act as a dictionary key. The exact same thing with respect to the surname. McGovern would be bound to the surname dictionary key, and the value Millham would also be bound to this surname dictionary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:04:24\n",
    "This might not seem quite so obvious just quite yet, but that is a really useful way to be able to work with your data. As we explored any previous skill within this code Python dictionaries are super, super useful, and thus debt reader class is going to allow it to leverage that same type of functionality for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:04:41\n",
    "So again, I really would encourage you to explore some of this documentation that is so much more that I can't cover quite just now. Because it would simply take a very, very long time because of so much here. So really, if you do have questions, I hope we're going to learn with the next scale, that really is the best place to go.\n",

    "\n",
    "00:00:00\n",
    "[MUSIC PLAYING] Hey guys, and welcome back. So let's see how we can create a very simple spreadsheet. A spreadsheet that we can use to work with the csv module within Python. Now, I'm going to be using, and briefly demonstrating, two very popular packages, which you can use to work with spreadsheets.\n",
    "\n",
    "00:00:29\n",
    "The first one, if you happen to be working with one of those, will no doubt be familiar with you. And that is Microsoft Excel. Now I do believe Microsoft Excel is a paid solution. In which case, if you don't have access to Excel, I would recommend that you use an Ubuntu operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "00:00:46\n",
    "Because what Ubuntu is going to come already packaged, LibreOffice. That is going to give you many of the Microsoft Office style applications, except that it's not paid, it's not by Microsoft, it is Linux open source. And, luckily for us, it's free to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "00:01:03\n",
    "So I'll briefly demonstrate both of these. So the first one, let's go into Microsoft Excel. So if you happen to have Microsoft Excel installed, then what you can do is go down to your bottom left hand corner and search for Excel. Now that Excel has been opened, all I'm going to see is going to a blank workbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "00:01:23\n",
    "And let me just zoom in a little bit here. So quite simply, all I'm going to do is to add in some fields here. So we can see here, at the very top, we have our columns A, B, C, D. So on and so forth. And then as we move down, we have all of the rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "00:01:37\n",
    "Now, all I'm going to do here is go in and specify some information. So let me click on one here. And I'll just say that says the forename. And then go into B. Double click this. I'll make this the surname. I'm going to C, and I'll just say email. So we could just fill out some information.\n",
    "\n",
    "00:01:53\n",
    "Let's say John, and I'll just say McGovern. If I can spell my own name correctly, that is. So let's click the next column. And I'll just make the email John at blah dot com. I'll just drag this over a little bit. And I'll say Trevor, and we have Sullivan, and I'll just say Trevor at blah dot com again.\n",
    "\n",
    "00:02:14\n",
    "And then we'll say Simona, Millham. And then we'll say Simona at blah dot com. And I'm just going to save this here as Nugget sheet one. OK, so what we have here, is a not so flashy spreadsheet. It's super, super basic. But what I want to do, is to highlight how you can create that same spreadsheet just using comma separated values directly from a text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "00:02:37\n",
    "So what I'll do here, is I'll switch to my terminal. I'll go into my directory. Let's activate my virtual environment, if I can do that correctly, that would be super helpful. I'll source bin my activator, and we'll go back out. Let's create a directory called spreadsheet stuff, and we'll csv into this, kill.\n",
    "\n",
    "00:02:56\n",
    "So what I'm going to do here, is I'm going to create a file. And I'll just call this spread-- again if I could spell, that would be super good, spreadsheet one. And I'll just make it with the csv extension. What I'm going to do here, is I'm going to open this up right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "00:03:11\n",
    "So spreadsheet stuff. So let me show you how you can write that exact same spreadsheet just using text, right here. So the very first thing I'm going to do is to specify the fields I want. So I'll say forename. And how do we get the next file. You'll separate the next file, we use a comma.\n",
    "\n",
    "00:03:27\n",
    "So I can say comma, and then I can say surname, and then I can say email, kill. So now if I say John, McGovern, John at blah dot com, and I say Trevor, Sullivan, and then Trevor at blah dot com, and then Simona, Millham, Simona at blah dot com, kill.\n",
    "\n",
    "00:03:48\n",
    "So I just save this right here. Now here's the thing, that's just a basic text file, with some comma separated values, of course. But here's the thing, If we happen to open this document, this text file, within something like Excel or LibreOffice, then it's actually going to be interpreted based on these comma separated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "00:04:08\n",
    "And it's going to be laid out in the exact same way. So let me show you this. Let's go back to our terminal then, now that we have this file saved. We have this new file here. We can cat it. There, it's there. Now let's open this using Microsoft Excel.\n",
    "\n",
    "00:04:24\n",
    "Now what I'm using here, for this terminal, is Windows Subsystem for Linux. So to be able to access this location here, a very neat trick that you can do if you follow along using WSL, just like me, is to say explorer dot exe, which is going to open up Microsoft, or rather Windows Explorer.\n",
    "\n",
    "00:04:41\n",
    "And where do we want to open up, we want to open up right where we are right now. So if we just say dots, and if we hit Enter, Explorer is going to open up with WSL. So Windows is opened up right here. And we have spreadsheet one. Because it's a dot csv, Windows knows to interpret this, as it's going to be opened with Microsoft Excel.\n",
    "\n",
    "00:05:02\n",
    "So if I just double click this, it's going to actually open up Excel. And there we have it, right there. We've actually created this file. So I just drag this over a little bit. You see we have the exact same effect. And again, we can quickly modify this.\n",
    "\n",
    "00:05:14\n",
    "Let's go back to our terminal. I could go back into this file, once again, spreadsheet dot csv. Let's add another one. Let's say, Keith, comma Barker, and we'll say, Keith at blah dot com. Let's save here. So if we just save this right here, let's go back to your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "00:05:33\n",
    "Let's say Explorer dot exe dot. Once again, what's the answer. And if we just double click this, now we can see we've actually added Keith. Let me just zoom in briefly. Do view, zoom, 200, and let's just drag this over a little bit. So clearly, we can see here, that we can easily create spreadsheets from basic text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "00:05:52\n",
    "And this is exactly how we're going to be able to populate our spreadsheets using text data we pull from our networking devices. Now, let me quickly show you that using Linux, in case you don't have access to Microsoft Excel. So I'm now on my Ubuntu virtual machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "00:06:07\n",
    "What I'm going to do here, is if I go to show applications, if I search for LibreOffice, I go into LibreOffice calc, right here. LibreOffice calc is basically the spreadsheet components of LibreOffice. Basically the open source version of Microsoft Excel.\n",
    "\n",
    "00:06:23\n",
    "So just the same as we saw before, we have our columns at the top, we have our rows down the left hand side. We can manually populate these, right here, by clicking on values, like say John. And this is a bit small. Let me zoom in a bit again. And, in fact, I should be changing that to forename, and then double click, surname, the exact same as we saw before.\n",
    "\n",
    "00:06:41\n",
    "But what we can do, just as we saw before, is we go to our terminal, I enter a file called new example two dot csv. So I could say here as nano new example two dot csv. And again, let's just call this first name, last name. First name, last name, email, and then maybe age.\n",
    "\n",
    "00:07:02\n",
    "I say John McGovern, John at blah blah dot com this time. And John's age is 35. Bob Smith, Bob's email will be Bob at blah blah dot com. And Bob can be a nice ripe age of 25. And we'll say Danielle, maybe Lewis, Danielle at blah blah dot com. And Danielle can be 40.\n",
    "\n",
    "00:07:27\n",
    "So if we just save this, we can say control all, and then control X. We can cat this file and the example. There we have this comma separated file. What we could do now, is actually open this within LibreOffice. If I actually do this here, let's go to files, open.\n",
    "\n",
    "00:07:42\n",
    "Let's go to home, where the file actually is. We have the example two dot csv. Double click this, and we'll just say OK, here. Look at this, we've actually created this spreadsheet just from a basic text field using a comma separated values. So whether you have access to Microsoft Excel, or if you're just using Linux, you're going to be easily able to create these types of spreadsheets.\n",
    "\n",
    "00:08:03\n",
    "So now that we have these spreadsheets up and running, let's try to read them using that csv module. That's coming up next in the very next Nugget. So I hope this has been informative for you, and I'd like to thank you for viewing.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 00:00:29\n",
    "We can cat it. And there are our values. Now, what I'm actually going to suggest to you is that, if you happen to be using VS Code, is that there actually is a cool little extension that we can use to help work with our CSV files. So what I'm going to do here is, go to File.\n",

    "#### 00:01:17\n",
    "So what we'll do here is, I'll create a file, and I'll just call this script1.py. And let's go in and edit this then. So, script1.py. Now, the first thing which I'm going to do is to import that CSV module. Now, you'll remember from a previous skill in this course, we understood what a context manager is.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:01:36\n",
    "It's going to allow us to open a file. And then naturally, it's going to automatically close it for us. So right now, let's use that context manager. We can do that using the with keyword. And we'll say, with open. And then within parentheses, we want to specify the name of the file we want to open.\n",

    "#### 00:01:53\n",
    "Well, we want to open spreadsheet1.csv. So within commas, let's say spreadsheet1.csv. And we want to open this in read mode, because we want to read the file. So we'll just say r, and we'll specify a variable name. Let's just say csv_data, maybe. Choose anything you like there.\n",

    "#### 00:02:12\n",

    "Now, indented within here, as we know, this is where we can perform our operations. And then once we leave this indented block, the context manager is automatically going to close this spreadsheet1.csv file. So what I'm going to do here is create a variable.\n",

    "I'll just say csv_reader. Again, call this anything you like. And all I'm going to do here is use the CSV module. If I say dot, we're going to see that we're going to have access to that reader function that we saw in an earlier Nugget. So I'll say reader.\n",

    "#### 00:03:00\n",
    "\n",
    "Cool. So let's just save this. Let's go back to our terminal. Then I can say Python 3, script1.py. And now we have this spreadsheet object, effectively. Now, right now, just printing this out isn't very useful. Let's see how we can actually access some of the information within this file then.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:03:18\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's go back once again. And what I'll do here is, I'll print out csv_reader. So let's save this. And if we just say Python 3, script1.py, hit Enter, we have this reader object. But right now, we're just seeing its position in memory. This is not exactly helpful to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:03:35\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 00:03:51\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the cool thing here, using this CSV module, is that we can easily index what it is we're trying to look for. So say, for example, if we look here at the actual file. This here, all this data is acting as list position 0 here. And all of this here-- It's a little bit muddy.\n",

    "#### 00:04:08\n",
    "\n",
    "This is position 1. I'll just clear this. And at the very end here, we have position 2. So what I could do here is, if I just wanted to get, say, for example, the emails.

    "Hey, guys, and welcome back. So let's now talk about how we can actually write end data to our CSV files and to our spreadsheets effectively. So for now what I'll do is I'll just create a new file. What do we have here already? We have spreadsheet1. csv.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:00:27\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's just create one called spreadsheet2. csv. Cool, so this is an empty file. We don't actually have anything within here quite just yet. What we'll do, though, is to write some data into this file then. Like you see, if we open up spreadsheet2, nothing in here.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:00:43\n",
    "\n",
    "What we'll do, though, is we'll create a new script. So we'll also say touch, and we'll say script2.py. And let's go into script2 then, so open this file, script2. Again we're going to import CSV. And we'll use our context manager once again. We'll say with open.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:01:00\n",
    "This time the name of the file is going to be spreadsheet2.csv. And this time we actually want to open it in write mode. And we'll open it as csv_data, once again. And we'll say csvwriter. Again you can call this anything you want, and what we'll do is we'll take our CSV module and we'll use the writer function this time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:01:22\n",
    "\n",
    "So passing in to the writer function is going to be this csv_data, which is what we've opened using our context managers. We'll say csv_data. And what we can do now is we can take this object, csvwriter, and we'll use the writerow method. Now this is actually going to take a list object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:01:42\n",
    "\n",
    "So what I'll say here is just following the same type of format. We'll just say forename, and then we'll say surname, and then we'll say email. So if I just save this right now, go back to my script, or rather to my table, should I say, let's say Python3 script2.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:02:00\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's hit enter. That script has executed. Let's go back into our spreadsheet2 now. And now we've populated the spreadsheet with those values. See that, forename, surname, email? We've wrote that as a row. Now here's the thing, what I can actually do here is I can just add in more rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:02:17\n",
    "\n",
    "I can say csvwriter, and I can say a writerow. And again we'll pass in a list object. So this time, it will actually be the values corresponding. So the first forename is going to be John, the next one is going to be McGovern, and the next one is going to be the email, which is just going to be again john.blahblahblah.com So again if I just save this and I go back to my terminal right here, if I arrow up, hit Enter, that should now create a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:02:45\n",
    "\n",
    "And see that, we now have John and the surname as McGovern and the email as johnblahblahblah.com. And again I can just add in more rows as I see fit. I can do csvwriter.writerow, again add in a list, say Trevor, Sullivan, trevor@randomemail.com. Let's change it and be super creative here.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:03:06\n",
    "\n",
    "So again we'll save this, go back to our terminal. I'm going to run script2 again, hit enter. Then we go. We've rewrote wrote the file. And now we have this new data written in. Now this is a pretty manual process, having to go through every single line and continually fill in all the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:03:22\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not really helping us in terms of automation. But we're seeing how we can use these methods and these functions to actually get the output we want. What we actually want to do though, is to incorporate things, such as for loops to loop through data and just to continually append that information into that CSV file, as opposed to having to manually just type every single forename, every single surname, and every single email.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:03:47\n",
    "\n",
    "And that strategy is much more in line with what we're going to be doing very, very shortly when we begin pulling network data from our devices and begin writing that data into our CSV files. But for now what I want to show you also is that we can also change the delimiter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:04:02\n",
    "\n",
    "Like I say, it's called a comma separated value because that is the default. But we can separate our values using say, for example, things like dollar signs or percentages or tabs. Whatever you choose, you can specify that. So how about we read then our initial spreadsheet, which is spreadsheet1, which is actually using the comma to separate our values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:04:25\n",
    "\n",
    "How about we read that data and then we write a new file using a different delimiter. Maybe say we'll separate the values using a tab. Let's see how we can do that. So what I'll do here is I'll say script3.py. We'll go into the script here, and you guessed it, I'm going to import CSV.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:04:42\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, we'll use our context manager, no surprise there. We're going to open not spreadsheet2. This time we're going to open spreadsheet1. That is the data we want to be able to copy, and then just write and again using data from the delimiter. So we'll open spreadsheet1.csv, and we'll open that as again we'll just choose csv_data just to be consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:05:04\n",
    "\n",
    "Use anything you so choose though. And we'll say csv_reader. Again, call this anything you like. And what I'm going to do is take my CSV module, use the reader function, and I'm going to pass in this object csv_data which we have opened. So now we have access to all of that data within that file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:05:21\n",
    "\n",
    "And what I'm going to do here is to create another context manager to write out our data. This is going to be again indented within the original context manager. So be careful of the indentation. Here we're going to open another with statement. We'll say with open.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:05:37\n",
    "\n",
    "And you know what, let me just create a new file. Let's just call this newfile.csv, which again is a blank file, nothing in this quite just yet. What I'll do here is I'll say with open. I'll say newfile.csv. This time you want to use the write mode. And I suppose I really should say r here.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:05:56\n",
    "\n",
    "R Is actually the default mode as we learned before when we're working with text files. But just to be explicit, it's probably better to specify it outright so there's no ambiguity. So we'll say write mode, and I'll just save this as let's just say maybe new_data, and I'll create a variable called csv_writer, and I'll take my CSV module, use the writer function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:06:15\n",
    "\n",
    "If I can take correctly once again matching that keypads. And I'm going to have to pass in the new data object we've just created here. We'll say new data. This time though we don't just want to write in the data as an exact copy. Now what I want to do here is to specify a different delimiter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:06:32\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't want the default delimiter of a comma. We want to let's say for example, use a tab key. And the way we can do a tab key in Python is by saying backslash t. And now what I'm going to do, I'm going to write into this file. So I'm going to take the information from csv_reader, which is going to contain all of the spreadsheet1 information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:06:53\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to write into csv_writer, which is going to have a different delimiter. Now to actually get all the data from within spreadsheet1, i.e. Within that csv_reader object, I'm going to have to iterate through all the different lines. So what I'll say here is for line in csv_reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:07:11\n",
    "\n",
    "And then I'm going to take the new file I want to write to, which is csv_writer. And I'll say write row. And what I want to write, I just want to write in the line I am iterating through. So that should now take everything within spreadsheet1.csv, i.e. all of this stuff here, we'll write it to a new file, except this time we won't be separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:07:30\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to be separated out using tabs. Check this out. Let's save this, and let's try out running the script then. So I'll clear the screen. I'll say Python3 script3.py, hit Enter. That's that created. Let's go and open up our new file then so we can see.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:07:46\n",
    "\n",
    "We have newfile.csv. It should now be populated. Let's open this up. And look at this, that's the same data as spreadsheet1. This time though spreadsheet1 is using comma to separate out those values, but the new file is now using tabs. So we can see here, even though it is called a CSV, a comma separated value, that as a default we can change the values by using a different delimiter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 00:08:10\n",
    "\n",
    "We can specify that as an argument. So, so far, we've read data, we've written data, let's see how we can use dictionary keys within our CSV files to maybe make this data or working with this data a little bit easier.
